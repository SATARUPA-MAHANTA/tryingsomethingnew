    <p>This page is a funny attempt by me in learning HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT and creating something on my own from scratch.This website is a pretty ancient looking
    site as it is based on pure HTML programming. If you are an expert do drop in a message in the contact me link below to let me know me how i did. If you are not an
  expert donot, I repeat donot make fun of this, because it took a lot of effort from my side to learning this and to have written atleast 200 lines of code till now. So don't make me sad.</p>
